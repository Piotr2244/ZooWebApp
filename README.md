This is a very simple .NET application created by me. I'm not very advanced in using .NET, but my goal is to learn it and improve this
little project to gain more experience using this framework.

The app represents a small zoo where users can read about the current inhabitants and find out their favorite snacks. 
The prices of the snacks are also visible, so anyone who wants to buy a snack for an animal can see all the details.

This is an early stage of this project, so anyone who is logged in can modify the data. This issue will likely be handled later as the project progresses.
